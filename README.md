# Data Engineering Notes and Frameworks (Derived + Original Work)

This repository contains my structured notes, tables, and architectural interpretations based on an online data engineering course. 
While the underlying concepts originate from the course material, the presentation, formatting, explanations, ASCII tables, 
and professional structuring have been fully transformed into my own style for clarity, accessibility, and practical use.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Translate instructional content into clean, professional, architect‑grade documentation.
- Present Spark, ingestion patterns, and data engineering concepts in a simplified, structured, and business‑aligned format.
- Provide reusable reference material for engineers, analysts, and architects.

## Attribution and Original Work
This repository contains two types of content:

### 1. **Derived Knowledge**
All the knowledge is derived from thinking about concepts, definitions, and workflows those are based on an online course.  
These have been rewritten, reorganized, and re‑explained in my own voice and structure for professional ease.

### 2. **Original Contributions (Fully My Work)**
The following elements are entirely my own intellectual work:
- ASCII tables  
- Two‑word logic frameworks  
- Business utility matrices  
- SOP‑style ingestion steps  
- Architectural summaries  
- Explanatory diagrams (ASCII)  
- All rewritten interpretations and professional structuring
